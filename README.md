Usage:

1. Connect your MateBook Pro to Mac, and do the following steps on Mac
2. Setup code signing in DevEco-Studio
3. Run `./create-hnp.sh` to create hnp package from alpine busybox-static package
4. Run `./build-macos.sh`
5. Run `./push.sh ./entry/build/default/outputs/default/entry-default-signed.hap`
6. Input command in the text input of the application, press enter

## How does it work

By examining CodeArts IDE, we found that it utilizes HNP packages for native programs. You need to package `.hnp` files into the `.hap`, and add them to `module.json5` like:

```json5
{
  "module": {
    "hnpPackages": [
      {
        "package": "busybox.hnp",
        "type": "private"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, you need to add the `.hnp` files to `.hap` and sign the `.hap` manually. You can refer to `sign.py` to see how it is done. The `.hnp` packages are unpacked under `/data/app` automatically and symlinks are created under `/data/app/bin`.
